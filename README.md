# Search Algorithm Test

Walk-Through:
1. Go to: https://search-al.herokuapp.com/
2. This will direct you to the index.php page
3. In the search box, type in the keyword (ex. "Sofa 2 Dudukan Vienna") 
4. Click "GO!"
5. This will direct you to the search.php page and show you the best matched result
6. To see the next best matched result, refresh the page (ex. command+r)
7. If you keep refreshing the page, it will eventually show you all the products offered
8. After the last product is shown, it will go back to the first result
9. To search for another keyword, go back to index, press the button "Back To Index"

Thanks!
